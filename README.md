A [LoupixDeck](https://github.com/RadiatorTwo/LoupixDeck) plugin for day-to-day
Claude: open Claude (optionally with a prompt), Quick entry, a Claude Code
session launcher, usage gauges for your 5-hour and 7-day limits, and a key that
lights when a Claude Code session is waiting for you. Built
against `LoupixDeck.PluginSdk` 1.30.0 (so it needs a LoupixDeck build with that
SDK) and targets .NET 10; runs on macOS, Linux
and Windows, with the limits listed under [Platform support](#platform-support).

This is an independent project and is not affiliated with Anthropic.

## Platform support

| Feature | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open, New Code session, Continue last | Desktop app (deep link) or browser | Desktop app (deep link) or browser | Browser only |
| Quick entry | Yes | Yes | `No desktop app` (needs the desktop app on every OS) |
| Current state key: state and project name | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Current state key: tap focuses the session | Yes | Desktop app sessions only; otherwise the key shows the session name | Key shows the session name |
| Usage keys | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Deep links (`claude://`) need the Claude desktop app, which exists for macOS and
Windows. Without it:

- `Claude.Open` falls back to `https://claude.ai/new`.
- `Claude.NewCodeSession` and `Claude.ContinueLast` fall back to `https://claude.ai/code`.

## Install

**From the Plugin Store.** Once the plugin is listed, it appears under
LoupixDeck → Plugins → Store and updates from there.

**Manually.** Download `claude-<version>-any.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/web-engineer/LoupixDeck.Plugin.Claude/releases)
page and unzip it into the plugin folder:

| OS | Folder |
|---|---|
| macOS, Linux | `~/.config/LoupixDeck/plugins/claude/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\LoupixDeck\plugins\claude\` |

Restart LoupixDeck, then enable the plugin for your device under
Plugins → Installed. The folder must contain `LoupixDeck.Plugin.Claude.dll`,
its `.deps.json`, `icon.png` and `plugin.json`.

**Then**, for the keys that need it:

- Quick entry: set Claude › Settings › System › Quick access shortcut to the
  same shortcut as the plugin's *Quick entry shortcut* setting (see below).
- Usage: run `claude` once and sign in (`claude`, then `/login`), on every OS.
  The plugin then finds the sign-in itself. See [Usage keys](#usage-keys).
- The Quick entry keystroke needs the Accessibility permission that
  LoupixDeck already asks for on macOS.

## Build from source

Requires the .NET 10 SDK. The project sits at the repository root:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

The build restores `LoupixDeck.PluginSdk` from nuget.org. A post-build step copies
the output into the host's plugin folder, so a rebuild followed by a LoupixDeck
restart is the whole loop:

| Host build | Target folder |
|---|---|
| Release host (default) | `~/.config/LoupixDeck/plugins/claude/` |
| Debug host (`-p:LoupixDebugHost=true`) | `~/.config/LoupixDeck/debug/plugins/claude/` |
| Windows | `%AppData%\LoupixDeck\plugins\claude\` |

Pass `-p:LoupixSkipInstall=true` to build without copying. `LoupixDeck.PluginSdk.dll`
and `*.runtimeconfig.json` are deliberately not copied: the host supplies the SDK
assembly and a second copy breaks plugin loading. Stop LoupixDeck before
rebuilding; the host holds the DLL open.

## Settings

Open LoupixDeck → Plugins → Claude → Settings. Saving applies immediately; the
workers restart from the next key render.

| Setting | Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quick entry shortcut | `quick_entry_shortcut` | `Alt+Space` (macOS, i.e. Option+Space), `Ctrl+Alt+Space` (Windows, Linux) | Sent as a key press. Must match Claude › Settings › System › Quick access shortcut. Empty: the key shows `Set shortcut`. |
| Show usage | `show_usage` | on | Off: no requests are made and the usage keys show `off`. |
| Access token (optional) | `access_token` | empty | Only needed when the Claude Code sign-in cannot be found. See [Usage keys](#usage-keys). |
| Alert me when Claude wants input | `alert_waiting` | on | Off: the session folder is not watched and the Current state key shows `Off`. |
| Session folder (optional) | `sessions_dir` | empty (`~/.claude/sessions`) | Override only if Claude Code keeps its session files elsewhere. |

Key names in the shortcut field use the host's macro syntax: `Alt` is the
Option key on macOS, and `Cmd` and `Win` both mean the Command key.

Two buttons on the page:

- **Test usage lookup** resolves the token, queries the usage endpoint and reports
  where the token came from and both windows, for example
  `Token from macOS Keychain. 5-hour window 42% used, resets in 3h12; 7-day window 18% used, resets in 4d.`
  or the reason it failed.
- **List Claude Code sessions** reports each live session as
  `name (project): busy|waiting|idle`, or that there are none.

## Commands

Command ids are permanent. All commands are in the group "Claude".

Claude keys share one look so they stand out on the deck: a Claude-orange
(`#FF551C`) background with white icons and text. On a touch key the launcher
and usage commands bring that look as ordinary layers when you assign them: an
icon layer, text layers and, for usage, an indicator layer, with the orange as
the key's own background colour. Restyle any of them in the button editor. A key
that had the command before version 0.2.0 has no layers; assign the command
again to get them.

| Command id | Key shows |
|---|---|
| `Claude.Open` | Chat icon, `Open Claude` |
| `Claude.QuickEntry` | Prompt icon, `Claude` |
| `Claude.NewCodeSession` | Code icon, `New Code` |
| `Claude.ContinueLast` | History icon, `Continue` |

| Command id | Parameter | Targets | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Claude.Open` | `Prompt` (optional) | all | Opens a new chat via `claude://claude.ai/new`, or `https://claude.ai/new` without the desktop app. With a prompt it adds `?q=<prompt>` (URL-escaped) to prefill the box. |
| `Claude.QuickEntry` | none | all | Sends the *Quick entry shortcut* with `System.KeyCombination(...)`. Quick entry has no deep link. Without the desktop app it shows `No desktop app`. |
| `Claude.NewCodeSession` | none | all | Opens `claude://code/new`, or `https://claude.ai/code`. |
| `Claude.ContinueLast` | none | all | Opens `claude://code/continue?session=last`, or `https://claude.ai/code`. |
| `Claude.Waiting` | none | touch buttons | Stateful key for Claude Code sessions. See below. |
| `Claude.UsageFiveHour` | none | touch buttons | The 5-hour window: one ring, percentage and time until reset. |
| `Claude.UsageWeekly` | none | touch buttons | The 7-day window: one ring, percentage and time until reset. |

When nothing could be launched, a touch button briefly shows `Claude not found`.

### Current state key

`Claude.Waiting` (listed as *Current state*) has three button states that follow the live sessions. Each
state brings its own layers when you assign the command, and you can restyle
them per state in the button editor:

| State | Meaning | Layers |
|---|---|---|
| `waiting` | At least one session is waiting on a permission prompt or a question | Inverted, orange on white: a bell, the project name (text source *Value*) and `+N more` when several are waiting (*Value detail*) |
| `busy` | Sessions are working, none needs you | An hourglass on orange |
| `idle` | No session needs you | Zzz on orange; a *Value* text shows `Off` while alerts are switched off |

A Current state key assigned before version 0.2.0 keeps its old empty states. Clear
the key and assign the command again to get these layers.

A session that has merely finished its turn is `idle` and does not light the key.

Tap the key to focus the waiting session. With several waiting, each tap moves
to the next one. With nothing waiting it shows `Nothing waiting`.

The key reads the session files Claude Code writes to `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`
(`status` is `busy`, `waiting` or `idle`). This covers the CLI, the VS Code
extension and the desktop app's Code tab. No hooks and no Claude Code
configuration are needed. Sessions whose process has exited are ignored, so a
crashed session never lights the key.

Focusing:

- **macOS.** The plugin walks up the process tree from the session's pid to the
  first app bundle (VS Code, Terminal, iTerm and so on) and activates it. For the
  Claude desktop app it opens `claude://code/needs-input`, which also selects the
  right tab.
- **Windows.** Only sessions started from the Claude desktop app are focused
  (via `claude://code/needs-input`). For anything else the key shows the session
  name instead of focusing a window.
- **Linux.** The key never focuses a window; it shows the session name.

### Usage keys

`Claude.UsageFiveHour` and `Claude.UsageWeekly` each show one window. The plugin
reports the value and the key's layers draw it:

| Layer | Kind | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Usage ring | Indicator | A white ring on a darkened track; full is 100 % used |
| Window | Text | `5h` or `week` |
| Percent | Text, source *Value* | The percentage, e.g. `17%` |
| Reset | Text, source *Value detail* | Time until the window resets, e.g. `3h12` or `4d` |

The combined two-ring key (`Claude.Usage`) from 0.1.0 is gone; use the two keys
side by side.

Tap either of them to fetch now and show a short overlay with both percentages and
reset times.

**This is an undocumented endpoint.** The key calls
`https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, the same unofficial endpoint Claude
Code's `/usage` uses, with the Claude Code OAuth token. It may change or
disappear without notice, and it may rate-limit you. The response is parsed
leniently; a response without either window shows `Unexpected response`.

- The key polls every 5 minutes while it is in use.
- On HTTP 429 the poll backs off, doubling from 5 minutes up to a 30 minute cap,
  and returns to 5 minutes after a good response.
- On any failure the last good values stay on the keys, marked `! stale` where the
  reset time normally is. With no values yet the keys show a dash and a short
  error.
- A 401 or 403 shows `Sign in to Claude Code again`.

**Token lookup order:**

1. macOS only: the Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials`, read with the
   `security` command line tool.
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, which Claude Code writes on Linux and Windows
   (on Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json`).
3. The *Access token* setting.

On every OS the fix is the same: run `claude` once and sign in (`claude`, then
`/login`), and the token is found automatically. If the plugin says it cannot
find a sign-in, paste into the *Access token* field either the whole credentials
JSON (the `claudeAiOauth` object Claude Code stores) or the bare access token
(it starts with `sk-ant-`).

The token is held only in memory and is never logged. A pasted token is stored in
the plugin's `settings.json` like any other setting. Access tokens expire and
Claude Code refreshes them when it runs; the plugin does not refresh anything, so
a pasted token will need pasting again. Prefer the automatic lookup.

## Polling and cost

Both workers start on demand and stop when nobody is looking:

| Worker | Runs while | Stops after |
|---|---|---|
| Session watcher (file watcher plus a 10 s rescan) | A `Claude.Waiting` key is on the current page and *Alert me when Claude wants input* is on | 30 s without the key being rendered |
| Usage poller (every 5 min) | A usage key is on the current page and *Show usage* is on | 12 min without the key being rendered |

Both toggles are on by default. With a LoupixDeck build that pauses display
polling while the device is off, both workers also stop when the device is off.
The launcher commands run no background work.

## Privacy

The only network traffic is the usage request to `api.anthropic.com`, made with
your Claude Code token, and only while a usage key is in use. Nothing else leaves
the machine. Session files in `~/.claude/sessions` are read locally and never
sent anywhere. Launcher commands open `claude://` links or claude.ai pages
through your system, which is the same as opening them yourself.

## Releasing and the Plugin Store

Packaging follows the SDK's
[Packaging & Distribution](https://github.com/RadiatorTwo/LoupixDeck.PluginSdk/blob/master/docs/Packaging-and-Distribution.md)
guide. `.github/workflows/release.yml` calls the SDK's reusable
`plugin-release.yml`; nothing else is needed in this repository.

1. Bump the version in three places so they match: `plugin.json` (`version`),
   `LoupixDeck.Plugin.Claude.csproj` (`<Version>`) and
   `ClaudePlugin.Metadata.Version`.
2. Push, then publish a GitHub Release whose tag is exactly `v<version>`, with
   release notes.
3. The workflow attaches `claude-<version>-any.zip`, `plugin.json` and
   `SHA256SUMS` to the release.
4. First listing, and every later release: open a pull request against
   [RadiatorTwo/LoupixDeck](https://github.com/RadiatorTwo/LoupixDeck) that adds
   or updates the `claude` entry in `plugin-store.json` (`repository`
   `web-engineer/LoupixDeck.Plugin.Claude`, `commandPrefixes` `["Claude."]`,
   `minSdkVersion` `1.30.0`), with the `release` object from the workflow's job
   summary.

The repository must be public for the Store and the release download URLs to work.

## Logging

Plugin lines are prefixed `plugin:claude` in LoupixDeck's log
(`~/.config/LoupixDeck/loupixdeck-startup.log` on macOS and Linux). At startup
the plugin logs whether the Claude desktop app was found. Workers log when they
start and stop, a successful usage lookup logs the two percentages and the token
source (never the token), and a 429 is logged as a warning.
